This project is built on the concept of automating the process of building a portfolio where you are able to add and update the projects that you have developed.

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

This project runs on using the terminal and node. If you have yet to [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/) please do so before downloading this application.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
1. Open up a terminal in my case I am using bash.
2. Change the directory to the directory where you downloaded the file.
3. Type `node app` in the directory to run the program
